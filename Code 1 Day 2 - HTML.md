Markup: a style guid for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or softcopy format
Language: a language that a computer system understands an uses to interpret commands

HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page lock good an interactive.
So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS an JavaScript to male your HTML beautiful an add interactivity, respectively 

## HTML Elements:
an element conisits of the opening tag, a character, the contetnt and a closing tag.
Some elements are empty - that is they dont have a clsing tag bunt instead have a source or a link to content that you want to embed on the web pace.
An example for an empty element is a <img>, wich you use to embed images on a web page.

So there are Tags to create headings, paragraphs, bolded words, italic words and more.
A tag for example loocks like this: < p >  < /p >  <-- The firt is the opening tah an the second the closing tah. between these you wirte the text you want to loock ore be a certin way.

< !doctype HTML > = HTML5  
< !doctype >  <-- specifies wich HTML type were using
< html > < /html >
< head > < /head >  <-- important information about the web page 
< title > < /title >  <-- Name of the web page
< body > < /body >  <-- all the content of the page is in here. Ther can only be one < body >
   
## HTML atributes
