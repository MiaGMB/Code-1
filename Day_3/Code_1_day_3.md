Today we first createt our Team Branch Story. The Story was about one of our team members going on a special trip. It became a pretty wieard story, but we had fun writing it. 

After that we lernd something about CSS. We started to manipulate a web page of our coise again. The we created a CSS Demo where we played orouned with the things we learnd and could use by now.

To learn more about selectors we were alble to play a litle game on a website called CSS Diner. That was fun.
