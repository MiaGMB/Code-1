Today we first createt our Team Branch Story. The Story was about one of our team members going on a special trip. It became a pretty wieard story, but we had fun writing it. 

Then we lernd some stuff about CSS. We also had to manipulate some web page of our coie agin. 
after that we played around with css an created a css demo, where we used different tags to cange the apearence of oure text for example.

To lear mor about selecters we were aple to play a game on a websited called CSS Diner.
