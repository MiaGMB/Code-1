Today we first createt our Team Branch Story. The Story was about one of our team members going on a special trip. It became a pretty wieard story, but we had fun writing it. We created an HTML Page were when you click on a button you get to the next page of the soty.

After presenting our storys we bacme ne tasks. Now we hat to get to know CSS. 
First we tryed to manipulate some web page of our coise agian. Then we created our own CSS Demo  where we played a little bit around.
To learn more about selectors we played a little learning game on a website called CSS Diner. That was fun.
