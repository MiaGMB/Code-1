Code 1 Notes Diary      Mia Reichmann GMB

{Day 1
Today our code lessons started. First we had to install different software. We had to install Git, node.js, Typescript and Visual Studio Code (ESLint, Git Graph).

Git
Git is a fast and efficient tool for managing small to large projects with branching, staging and workflows. 

Nodes.js
Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It can be used, for example, to run a web server.
